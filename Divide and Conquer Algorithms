Divide and Conquer is an algorithmic paradigm(sometimes mistakenly called "Divide and concur"),similar to Greedy and Dynamic Programming.

#1 Divide: Break the given problem into subproblems of same type.
#2 Conquer:Recursively solve these sub-problems.
#3 Combine: Appropriately combine the answers.

Following are some standard algorithms that are of the Divide and Conquer algorithms variety:

Binary Search
Quicksort
Merge Sort
Closest Pair of Points
Strassen's Algorithm
Cooley-Turkey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms
The Karatsubha algorithm
